# config-sync README

config-sync is a VSCode extension that makes it easier to initialize new projects by syncing in previous configuration files from similar projects. It removes the need to create files such as ESLint configurations or gitignores if you have set up a similar project in the past. Just run a command in VSCode and the files will be automatically added to your working directory.

It is recommended to set up a new MongoDB database for configuration files and connect it to config-sync. This enables syncing to a database instead of local storage.
